### Picture of ~~a~~ *THE* Goose.
![A very detailed mustached picture of a prim and propper goose. The picture is humbiling. As you look upon it, it fills you with a sense of wonder and a sense of awe; to a certain extent, it even seems quite humorous.](https://github.com/lukecashwell-alt/eportfolio/blob/master/public/apple-touch-icon-144-precomposed.png?raw=true)

This is a picture of a goose. You might be wondering; why is there a picture of a goose? Well, that is a very good question, and a question that deserveres to be answered. Do you notice anything about this picture? Do you notice anything which seperates it from any other pictures of geese you may have seen. At first, probably not. There is nothing too noticable to the untrained eye. To help with your discerning, here are a few more pictures of your normal, everyday, *average* goose. 

## The Stoic Goose

Look at this goose. Examine it; examine it as it examines you. Yes. Yes this goose is stoic... Always thinking... Always plotting...

## The Angry Goose
![A goose with its nose upturned. In anger at the camera man who dare to take a picture of its feathery white body.](https://github.com/lukecashwell-alt/eportfolio/blob/master/public/goose2.jpg?raw=true)

This goose, oooh this goose... This goose turns its nose up at you: its orange, smooth, *hairless* nose. If you stand still, it may go away; however, if you move a mussle, it will charge at you and bite your toes off.  

## Another Goose?
![A goose that is kind of shorter and stumpier. It has a shorter kneck, oh wait.. it's a duck not a goose.](https://github.com/lukecashwell-alt/eportfolio/blob/master/public/goose3.jpg?raw=true)

A yes, another goose. This goose is kind of short and stumpy and... oh wait. Look carefully... This isn't a goose; this is a duck. You must look very carefully to make sure that you do not confuse a duck with a goose. A goose is a goose and a duck is a duck. 

## Conclusion
Now that you have observered these feathery flocking animals, can you discern the difference between a goose and *THE* goose. if you look very closely at it's smooth orange nose, you may notice there is a little black thing on it. This is a mustache. A wonderful, majestic, life-giving mustache. Knowing this, you have no excuse for not appreciating this specific feathery friend.
